  abstract = {Turbulent boundary layer control (TBLC) for skin-friction drag reduction is a relatively new technology made possible through the advances in computational-simulation capabilities, which have improved the understanding of the flow structures of turbulence. Advances in micro-electronic technology have enabled the fabrication of active device systems able to manipulating these structures. The combination of simulation, understanding and micro-actuation technologies offers new opportunities to significantly decrease drag, and by doing so, to increase fuel efficiency of future aircraft. The literature review that follows shows that the application of active control turbulent skin-friction drag reduction is considered of prime importance by industry, even though it is still at a low technology readiness level (TRL). This review presents the state of the art of different technologies oriented to the active and passive control for turbulent skin-friction drag reduction and contributes to the improvement of these technologies.},

  abstract = {In the present work a technique is numerically investigated, which is aimed at reducing the friction drag in turbulent boundary layers and channel flows. A cyclic spanwise oscillation of the wall with a proper frequency and amplitude is imposed, allowing a reduction of the turbulent drag of up to 40\%. The present work is based on the numerical simulation of the Navier-Stokes equations in the simple geometry of a plane channel flow. The frequency of the oscillations is kept fixed at the most efficient value determined in previous studies, while the choice of the best value for the amplitude of the oscillations is evaluated not only in terms of friction reduction, but also by taking into consideration the overall energy balance and the power spent for the motion of the wall. The analysis of turbulence statistics allows to shed some light on the way oscillations interact with wall turbulence, as illustrated by visual inspection of some instantaneous flow fields. Finally, a simple explanation is proposed for this interaction, which leads to a rough estimate of the most efficient value for the frequency of the oscillations.},

  abstract = {Reduction of wall friction of turbulent boundary layer flows can be achieved by using surfaces with properties that are related to skin structures occurring in nature. The scales of several species of fast-swimming sharks show a tiny ribbed structure. This ribbed structure hampers the momentum exchange at the surface that is the origin of the turbulent shear stress. The drag-reducing mechanism of ribbed surfaces (or riblets) is explained by using an analytical model that defines the viscous region of the flow, where the riblets are completely immersed in the viscous sublayer of the turbulent boundary layer. Wall shear stress reduction has been investigated experimentally for various riblet surfaces including a replica of sharkskin consisting of 800 plastic model scales with compliant anchoring. The application of these types of structure to long-range commercial aircraft is discussed, including the effect of the drag reductions on the operational costs of the aircraft.},

  abstract = {The experimental control of turbulent boundary layers using streamwise travelling waves of spanwise wall velocity, produced using a novel active surface, is outlined in this paper. The innovative surface comprises a pneumatically actuated compliant structure based on the kagome lattice geometry, supporting a pre-tensioned membrane skin. Careful design of the structure enables waves of variable length and speed to be produced in the flat surface in a robust and repeatable way, at frequencies and amplitudes known to have a favourable influence on the boundary layer. Two surfaces were developed, a preliminary module extending 152 mm in the streamwise direction, and a longer one with a fetch of 2.9 m so that the boundary layer can adjust to the new surface condition imposed by the forcing. With a shorter, 1.5 m portion of the surface actuated, generating an upstream-travelling wave, a drag reduction of 21.5\% was recorded in the boundary layer with Re{$\tau$}=\,1125. At the same flow conditions, a downstream-travelling produced a much smaller drag reduction of 2.6\%, agreeing with the observed trends in current simulations. The drag reduction was determined with constant temperature hot-wire measurements of the mean velocity gradient in the viscous sublayer, while simultaneous laser Doppler vibrometer measurements of the surface recorded the wall motion. Despite the mechanics of the dynamic surface resulting in some out-of-plane motion (which is small in comparison to the in-plane streamwise movement), the positive drag reduction results are encouraging for future investigations at higher Reynolds numbers.},

The purpose of separation flow control is to raise the efficiency or to improve the performance of vehicles and fluid machineries involving many engineering applications. The chapter presents basic principles for control of separation with pertinent examples. The separation of flow may be controlled in two ways: (1) by prevention or delay of the onset of separation with elimination or decrease of separated regions and (2) by provoking localized separated flow by utilizing the characteristics of separated flow. As the two governing factors of flow separation are adverse pressure gradient and viscosity, the control of separation can be achieved by changing or maintaining the structure of viscous flow so that these two governing factors prevent or delay the separation. There are two methods of control, depending upon whether power is required or not required to achieve this goal.},

Estimates based on the assumption of similarity with drag reduction effect of in-plane wall motion suggest that drag reduction of about 2.4\% can be achieved in the flow past a wavy wall, with the crests forming an angle of about 38 degrees with the main flow direction, and the wave period in the main flow direction equal to about 1500 wall units. The required height of the wall waves have to be adjusted to achieve the same intensity of the spanwise motion as that created by an in-plane moving wall of the same wavelength and with peak wall velocity equal to 2 wall units. Further research is being conducted in order to determine this height. Suggestions are made for further research on confirming the feasibility of the proposed method and on optimising the wall shape.},

  abstract = {Direct numerical simulations of turbulent flows over riblet-mounted surfaces are performed to educe the mechanism of drag reduction by riblets. The computed drag on the riblet surfaces is in good agreement with the existing experimental data. The mean-velocity profiles show upward and downward shifts in the log\textendash law for drag-decreasing and drag-increasing cases, respectively. Turbulence statistics above the riblets are computed and compared with those above a flat plate. Differences in the mean-velocity profile and turbulence quantities are found to be limited to the inner region of the boundary layer. Velocity and vorticity fluctuations as well as the Reynolds shear stresses above the riblets are reduced in drag-reducing configurations. Quadrant analysis indicates that riblets mitigate the positive Reynolds-shear-stress-producing events in drag-reducing configurations. From examination of the instantaneous flow fields, a drag reduction mechanism by riblets is proposed: riblets with small spacings reduce viscous drag by restricting the location of the streamwise vortices above the wetted surface such that only a limited area of the riblets is exposed to the downwash of high-speed fluid that the vortices induce.},

  abstract = {The objective of this study is to explore concepts for active control of turbulent boundary layers leading to skin-friction reduction using the direct numerical simulation technique. Significant drag reduction is achieved when the surface boundary condition is modified to suppress the dynamically significant coherent structures present in the wall region. The drag reduction is accompanied by significant reduction in the intensity of the wall-layer structures and reductions in the magnitude of Reynolds shear stress throughout the flow. The apparent outward shift of turbulence statistics in the controlled flows indicates a displaced virtual origin of the boundary layer and a thickened sublayer. Time sequences of the flow fields show that there are essentially two drag-reduction mechanisms. Firstly, within a short time after the control is applied, drag is reduced mainly by deterring the sweep motion without modifying the primary streamwise vortices above the wall. Consequently, the high-shear-rate regions on the wall are moved to the interior of the channel by the control schemes. Secondly, the active control changes the evolution of the wall vorticity layer by stabilizing and preventing lifting of the spanwise vorticity near the wall, which may suppress a source of new streamwise vortices above the wall.}

  abstract = {Over the past forty years intensive investigations into the use of compliant surfaces have been undertaken, both theoretically and experimentally, in order to obtain turbulent drag reduction in boundary\textendash layer flows. Although positive results were found in some of the studies, none of these had been successfully validated by independent researchers. In this paper the results are reported of a recent investigation carried out by the authors to verify the experimental results of Semenov in 1991 and Kulik and co\textendash workers in 1991, who successfully demonstrated the ability of compliant surfaces to reduce the skin\textendash friction drag and surface\textendash flow noise in a turbulent boundary layer. A strain\textendash gauge force balance was used in the present study to directly measure the turbulent skin\textendash friction drag of a slender body of revolution in a water tunnel. Changes in the structure of turbulent boundary layer over a compliant surface in comparison with that over a rigid surface were also examined. The results clearly demonstrate that the turbulent skin friction is reduced for one of the two compliant coatings tested, indicating a drag reduction of up to 7 per cent within the entire speed range of the tests. The intensities of skin\textendash friction and wall\textendash pressure fluctuations measured immediately downstream from the compliant coating show reductions in the intensities of up to 7 and 19 per cent, respectively. The results also indicate reductions in turbulence intensity by up to 5 per cent across almost the entire boundary layer. Furthermore, an upwards shift of the logarithmic velocity profile is also evident indicating that the thickness of the viscous sublayer is increased as a result of turbulent drag reduction due to the compliant coating. It is considered that the results of the present experimental investigation convincingly demonstrate for the first time since the earlier work in Russia (by Semenov and Kulik) that a compliant surface can indeed produce turbulent drag reduction in boundary\textendash layer flows.},

In this study, the effects of the amplitude and the phase of wall blowing and suction control input were considered separately. It is found that the amplitude of wall blowing and suction as well as the detection plane location played an important role in active control for skin-friction drag reduction. By changing the amplitude, a substantial drag reduction was achieved for all detection plane locations considered, and the efficiency of the opposition control was also improved. When the control was effective, the drag reduction was proportional to the wall blowing and suction strength. There existed a maximum wall blowing and suction strength, beyond which the opposition control became less effective or even unstable. Turbulence characteristics affected by various wall blowing and suction parameters were analyzed to understand the underlying mechanisms for drag reduction. The wall-normal velocity and vorticity fluctuations showed a strong correlation with drag reduction.},

  abstract = {The interaction of the overlying turbulent flow with riblets, and its impact on their drag reduction properties are analysed. In the so-called viscous regime of vanishing riblet spacing, the drag reduction is proportional to the riblet size, but for larger riblets the proportionality breaks down, and the drag reduction eventually becomes an increase. It is found that the groove cross section A+g is a better characterization of this breakdown than the riblet spacing, with an optimum . It is also found that the breakdown is not associated with the lodging of quasi-streamwise vortices inside the riblet grooves, or with the inapplicability of the Stokes hypothesis to the flow along the grooves, but with the appearance of quasi-two-dimensional spanwise vortices below y+{$\approx$}30, with typical streamwise wavelengths . They are connected with a Kelvin\textendash Helmholtz-like instability of the mean velocity profile, also found in flows over plant canopies and other surfaces with transpiration. A simplified stability model for the ribbed surface approximately accounts for the scaling of the viscous breakdown with~A+g.},

  abstract = {The present paper describes the effect of drag reduction of circular cylinders due to a porous coating on their leeward sides. To investigate the coating effect, experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel of Goettingen type. Systematic drag measurements were carried out for different cylinder configurations and flow velocities. The drag measurements were complemented by pressure and particle image velocimetry (PIV) flow field measurements around selected cylinders. The Reynolds numbers were varied in the subcritical range of 3 \texttimes{} 104 {$<$} Re {$<$} 1.4 \texttimes{} 105. The results show that a thin porous layer on the leeward side, either incorporated in the cylinder shape or applied on the cylinder surface, leads to an increase of base pressure on the leeward side of the cylinder. It causes a reduction of drag and dampens oscillation amplitudes when compared to a cylinder without coating. Results obtained for different configurations with varying key parameters (coating angles, layer thicknesses and pore sizes of the porous material) clearly indicate the drag-reducing and amplitude-damping potential of leeward coating. The amount of drag reduction and amplitude damping depends on the combination of key parameters. It was demonstrated that the lowered drag coefficients cd were almost constant in the tested range of Reynolds numbers. A maximum reduction of drag of 13.2 \% was measured. In addition, the results revealed a strong reduction of the pressure fluctuations around cylinders with a leeward coating due to the shift of the vortex region further downstream.},

  abstract = {This paper highlights the technology development of two flow control concepts for aircraft drag reduction. The NASA Environmentally Responsible Aviation (ERA) project worked with Boeing to demonstrate these two concepts on a specially outfitted Boeing 757 ecoDemonstrator during the spring of 2015. The first flow control concept used Active Flow Control (AFC) to delay flow separation on a highly deflected rudder and increase the side force that it generates. This may enable a smaller vertical tail to provide the control authority needed in the event of an engine failure during takeoff and landing, while still operating in a conventional manner over the rest of the flight envelope. Thirty-one sweeping jet AFC actuators were installed and successfully flight-tested on the vertical tail of the 757 ecoDemonstrator. Pilot feedback, flow cone visualization, and analysis of the flight test data confirmed that the AFC is effective, as a smoother flight and enhanced rudder control authority were reported. The second flow control concept is the Insect Accretion Mitigation (IAM) innovation where surfaces were engineered to mitigate insect residue adhesion on a wing's leading edge. This is necessary because something as small as an insect residue on the leading edge of a laminar flow wing design can cause turbulent wedges that interrupt laminar flow, resulting in an increase in drag and fuel use. Several non-stick coatings were developed by NASA and applied to panels that were mounted on the leading edge of the wing of the 757 ecoDemonstrator. The performance of the coated surfaces was measured and validated by the reduction in the number of bug adhesions relative to uncoated control panels flown simultaneously. Both flow control concepts (i.e., sweeping jet actuators and non-stick coatings) for drag reduction were the culmination of several years of development, from wind tunnel tests to flight tests, and produced valuable data for the advancement of modern aircraft designs. The ERA systems analysis studies performed by NASA indicated that AFC-enhanced vertical tail could produce \textasciitilde 0.9\% drag reduction for a large twin aisle aircraft and IAM coatings could enable \textasciitilde 1.2\% drag reduction recovery for a potential total drag reduction of \textasciitilde 3.3\% for a single aisle aircraft with a natural laminar flow (NLF) wing design.},

  abstract = {This paper extends the resolvent analysis of McKeon \& Sharma (J. Fluid Mech., vol.~658, 2010, pp. 336\textendash 382) to consider flow control techniques that employ linear control laws, focusing on opposition control (Choi, Moin \& Kim, J. Fluid Mech., vol.~262, 1994, pp. 75\textendash 110) as an example. Under this formulation, the velocity field for turbulent pipe flow is decomposed into a series of highly amplified (rank-1) response modes, identified from a gain analysis of the Fourier-transformed Navier\textendash Stokes equations. These rank-1 velocity responses represent propagating structures of given streamwise/spanwise wavelength and temporal frequency, whose wall-normal footprint depends on the phase speed of the mode. Opposition control, introduced via the boundary condition on wall-normal velocity, affects the amplification characteristics (and wall-normal structure) of these response modes; a decrease in gain indicates mode suppression, which leads to a decrease in the drag contribution from that mode. With basic assumptions, this rank-1 model reproduces trends observed in previous direct numerical simulation and large eddy simulation, without requiring high-performance computing facilities. Further, a wavenumber\textendash frequency breakdown of control explains the deterioration of opposition control performance with increasing sensor elevation and Reynolds number. It is shown that slower-moving modes localized near the wall (i.e.~attached modes) are suppressed by opposition control. Faster-moving detached modes, which are more energetic at higher Reynolds number and more likely to be detected by sensors far from the wall, are further amplified. These faster-moving modes require a phase lag between sensor and actuator velocity for suppression. Thus, the effectiveness of opposition control is determined by a trade-off between the modes detected by the sensor. However, it may be possible to develop control strategies optimized for individual modes. A brief exploration of such mode-optimized control suggests the potential for significant performance improvement.},

  abstract = {Waves of spanwise velocity imposed at the walls of a plane turbulent channel flow are studied by direct numerical simulations. We consider sinusoidal waves of spanwise velocity which vary in time and are modulated in space along the streamwise direction. The phase speed may be null, positive or negative, so that the waves may be either stationary or travelling forward or backward in the direction of the mean flow. Such a forcing includes as particular cases two known techniques for reducing friction drag: the oscillating wall technique (a travelling wave with infinite phase speed) and the recently proposed steady distribution of spanwise velocity (a wave with zero phase speed). The travelling waves alter the friction drag significantly. Waves which slowly travel forward produce a large reduction of drag that can relaminarize the flow at low values of the Reynolds number. Faster waves yield a totally different outcome, i.e. drag increase (DI). Even faster waves produce a drag reduction (DR) effect again. Backward-travelling waves instead lead to DR at any speed. The travelling waves, when they reduce drag, operate in similar fashion to the oscillating wall, with an improved energetic efficiency. DI is observed when the waves travel at a speed comparable with that of the convecting near-wall turbulence structures. A diagram illustrating the different flow behaviours is presented.},

There are a number of review papers available on this subject, but few discuss on their latest developments. The purpose of the present article is to ``fill the gap'' by reviewing the recent trend of plasma actuator design and to summarise aerodynamic control techniques. Here, we review new plasma actuators, such as plasma synthetic jet actuators, plasma spark jet actuators, three-dimensional plasma actuators and plasma vortex generators, which can induce three-dimensional flows away from the wall. We also review the starting vortex that leads to formation of a plasma wall jet. This is an important subject not only for a better understanding of the flow induced by DBD plasma actuators, but also as a database that can be used to calibrate the numerical models for plasma flow control. Design of DBD plasma actuators to obtain turbulent skin-friction reduction is shown and the modifications to near-wall turbulence structures are summarised. Novel applications of DBD plasma actuators for aerodynamic control are then discussed, including pitch and roll control, plasma jet vectoring, circulation control and plasma flap, showing a potential of DBD plasma actuators for replacing movable, aircraft control surfaces. Finally, vortex shedding control techniques by a number of different plasma actuators are surveyed.},

  abstract = {Since the zero-net-mass-flux (ZNMF) jet was first used as a laboratory flow control method in 1990's, it has attracted much attention. The ZNMF jet has unique features such as compact actuator, no requirement for external air supply, complex piping, etc., and becomes a hot topic research subject in fluid mechanics. This review introduces the state of the art in the development of ZNMF jet in the quiescent fluid, the interaction of the ZNMF jet with the cross flow and its application in the separation flow control. The evolution of the vortex ring/pair and the spacial flow structure of the ZNMF in quicent fluid or cross flow are presented, as well as the key parameter effects. At last, the applications of ZNMF jet in the wake control of the circular cylinder, the separation control on the airfoil and the aerodynamic force or moment control on MAV/UAV are presented.},
